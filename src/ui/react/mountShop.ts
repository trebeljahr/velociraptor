/*
 * Mount helper for the React Shop overlay.
 *
 * The outer #shop-overlay div (with class="imprint-overlay") stays in
 * index.html so existing CSS (backdrop, open-state positioning) and
 * the open/close class toggle in ui.ts continue to work unchanged.
 * React only owns the sheet contents inside.
 *
 * refreshShop() is called from ui.ts's openShop() and is a no-op if
 * the host element isn't in the DOM yet. First call lazily creates
 * the root; subsequent calls re-render so the component re-reads
 * window.Game state (coin balance, inventory, owned/equipped).
