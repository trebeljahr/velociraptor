/*
 * Raptor Runner — audio subsystem.
 *
 * A single long-lived object that owns:
 *   • The <audio> element for looping background music
 *   • The <audio> element for rain ambience
 *   • A Web Audio context with pre-decoded buffers for jump + thunder
 *     SFX so layered sounds don't fight the music element
 *
 * State coupling: the only thing the audio module reads from the game
 * state singleton is the "Sound of Silence" achievement streak, which
 * gets broken if the player un-mutes mid-run. To keep this module free
 * of a hard dependency on state.ts, main.ts registers an
 * `onUnmuteDuringRun` callback during init().

  // ── Menu / pause coordination ──────────────────────────────
  // Intent: menus / pauses silence *only* the event-driven gameplay
  // SFX — the UFO hover loop, Santa bells loop, meteor / comet /
  // thunder tails, any in-flight step / jump / hit samples. The
  // ambient layer (music + rain) stays playing so the menu screen
  // doesn't feel like the game yanked its whole soundtrack out.
  //
  // When the pause menu opens (or Game.pause() fires for any other
  // reason — alt-tab, invisibility, external trigger), every sound
  // that belongs to gameplay should fall silent while the music keeps
  // playing. The user's framing: "santa, ufo and other non-music
  // sounds should stop".
  //
  // Strategy:
  //   • Web Audio context: a single suspend() call pauses every
  //     in-flight node — the UFO hover loop, the Santa bells loop,
  //     any meteor tail still rumbling, the comet glitter tail, any
  //     running-step or landing sample mid-fade. resume() picks them
  //     all back up at the exact sample they paused on.
  //   • Rain <audio>: Web Audio doesn't own it. We fade + pause the
  //     element directly on pause, and resume it on un-pause only
  //     if rain is still logically active (_isRainPlaying remains
  //     the source of truth) and no mute toggle has been flipped
  //     against it in the meantime.
  //   • Music: intentionally left alone — menu music is a UX staple.
  //
  // These methods are idempotent: calling pauseGameplaySounds twice
  // is harmless, and calling resume without a prior pause is a no-op.

   *    (b) Rain <audio> got paused while _isRainPlaying is still
   *        true — same orphan-state root cause. The game-loop's
   *        rain-management sees "already playing" and never
   *        rehydrates the element, so rain stays silent until
   *        the player toggles the sound off and back on.
   *
   *  Safe to call frequently — no-ops when audio is already
   *  live. Hooked into resetGame(), every pointerdown / keydown
   *  / gamepad button-press so any user gesture also wakes
   *  audio back up without the toggle workaround.
